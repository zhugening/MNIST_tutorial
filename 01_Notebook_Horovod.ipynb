    "\n",
    "- A high level introduction to Horovod, including its ties to the parallel computing protocol MPI, and the additional details that must be taken into account when using a parallel computing framework like Horovod.\n",
    "- An overview and initial run of the existing code base that you will be refactoring with Horovod, which is a classification model using Keras and the Fashion-MNIST dataset, currently built to run on a single GPU.\n",
    "- A multi-step refactor of the existing code base so that it uses Horovod to run distributed across this environment's available GPUs, introducing Horovod concepts and techniques throughout.\n",

    "[Horovod](https://github.com/horovod/horovod) is an open source tool originally [developed by Uber](https://eng.uber.com/horovod/) to support their need for faster deep learning model training across their many engineering teams. It is part of a growing ecosystem of approaches to distributed training, including for example [Distributed TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/deploy/distributed). Uber decided to develop a solution that utilized [MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) for distributed process communication, and the [NVIDIA Collective Communications Library (NCCL)](https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl) for its highly optimized implementation of reductions across distributed processes and nodes. The resulting Horovod package delivers on its promise to scale deep learning model training across multiple GPUs and multiple nodes, with only minor code modification and intuitive debugging."

In this lab we will be using the term \"rank\" extensively.

If you want to use multiple GPUs from this list, you can do so by manually controlling which \"device\" to use (see TensorFlow's [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/gpu) for more information). Typically one would do so when manual control over the distribution of data is needed, and a common use case is model parallelism (which Horovod [does not natively support](https://github.com/horovod/horovod/issues/96)). In this lab we will only be using one GPU per rank.

Notice that there is a \"GPU-Util\" column, which measures the GPU's utilization. It tells you what fraction of the last second the GPU was in use. We can thus easily monitor GPU activity by regularly checking this output. One way to do that is using the Linux utility [watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch_(Unix)): `watch -n 5 nvidia-smi` will set up a loop that refreshes the `nvidia-smi` output every 5 seconds. Make sure you run that in the separate terminal window, not here in the notebook, because the notebook can only run one process at a time. You can type Ctrl+C in the terminal to end the loop later."

Assuming we start from the beginning of the training (we won't handle checkpoint/restart in this lab, but [it is a straightforward extension](https://horovod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/keras.html)), this means that every processor needs to have the same random weights.\n",

    "As it stands, we are running the same number of steps per epoch for the serial training implementation. But since we have increased the number of workers by a factor of N, that means we're doing N times more work (when we sum the amount of work done over all processes). Our target was to get the *same* answer in less time (that is, to speed up the training), so we want to keep the total amount of work done the same (that is, to process the same number of examples in the dataset). This means we need to do a factor of N *fewer* steps per epoch, so the number of steps goes to `steps_per_epoch / number_of_workers`.\n",

While we could just do `num_test_iterations / number_of_workers` on each worker to get a linear speedup in the validation, the multiplier **3** provides over-sampling of the validation data and helps to increase the probability that every validation example will be evaluated."
